# 🏨 Front-End Project: Hotel Pomelia Luxury & Sustainability

## Project Goal
This project is a single-page website developed to showcase my skills in modern, responsive front-end development, specifically focusing on elegant design and complex layout structuring using HTML and CSS techniques.

## Core Features
1.  **Header Layout:** Implemented a three-column header structure (Logo, Centered Nav, CTA) using **Flexbox** and `margin: auto` for precise menu alignment.
2.  **Modular Content Grid:** The "Sustainability" section utilizes **CSS Grid** for an organized and interactive card layout, including intricate hover effects.
3.  **Semantic & Accessible HTML:** Used proper HTML5 semantic tags, ensuring every content image has a descriptive `alt` attribute for accessibility.
4.  **Style Management:** Employed **CSS Variables (`:root`)** for efficient theme management and consistency across the site.
5.  **Typography & Branding:** Used custom fonts (`Playfair Display` and `Montserrat`) to establish a clear visual brand identity.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5** (Semantic Structure)
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid Layout, Custom Properties/Variables)
* **RWD** (Responsive Web Design - implicitly ready for media queries)
